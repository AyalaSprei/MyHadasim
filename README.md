Hi:)
Task 1:

First after download run npm i
to install all the dependencies

Run the server (CoronaClinic.sln)
Run the client (ng s -o)

Task 2:

Run the console app and act according to instructions I printed

I would like to point out that I added another extreme case in which it will not be able to print - 
if the width is 3 and the height is greater than 2 - because according to the instructions you can only double the rows in the middle

Task 3:

 There is a word file attached
